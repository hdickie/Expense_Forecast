# Expense_Forecast

This repo is for the python module I am developing expense_forecast. 


In this implementation, the meaning of priority indices is implied by the way they are used in memo rules.
This is to allow custom priority indices to be implemented via configuration.

The way I am currently using it:
1. Non-negotiables (minimum cc and loan payments)
2. additional cc and loan payments
3. unskippable things i am willing  to pay interest on
4. deferrable things i am willing to pay interest on
5. unskippable things I am not willing to pay interest on
6. deferabble things I am not willing to pay interest on
7. additional loan payments
8. savings
9. investments


Plots I want:
1. Overall
2. Net worth
3. Marginal Interest
