# Expense_Forecast

This project has not had its first release.

The expense_forecast module is a tool that allows anyone with a beginner understanding of python to compute future trends of their spend. Different sets of decision rules can implemented to compute long-term trends and compare the impact on milestone dates. This module allows the user to "map dollars to days", yielding answers to questions such as: "if I spend $1000 today, how much longer will it take to pay off all my loans?".

This tool is useful for:
<ul>
<li>Amortizing lifestyle costs</li>
<li>Managing impulse spending</li>
<li>Tracking long-term financial goals</li>
</ul>
